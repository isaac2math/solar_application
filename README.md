## For details, see the paper "Accuracy and stability of variable selection comparison under data with complicated dependence structures" by Ning Xu (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15614).


## I applied solar prostate cancer data and high dimensional GIS-census data for house pricing.
> - The learning result provide a very sparse linear model with high prediction power.
> - The learning result recovers an intuitive, sparse and statistically significant causal structure from the high dimensional data
> - The learning result is intuitive and confirmed many empirical statistical issue like grouping effect, endogeneity and instrument selection.

## the detailed paper and procedure can be found at.
> the results are included in the following files
> - *costcom.py, simulator.py and solar.py* are the solar package
> - *Houseprice_2010.ipynb* is the variable selection result of solar compared to lasso and elastic net.
